title: Kanban Boards for Project Management
---

Within Github, the Projects Tab can provide a board with cards to organise issues collaboratively. If a team is already working within Github, this can be beneficial as everything remains in the same place.

"Issues" can be used as a record of ToDos or others flagging up bugs and features that need to be addressed. They can be attached to particular repos and assigned to people.

The Kanban board can be modified to whatever layout or structure makes sense to you. This example uses the concept to publication/release pipeline.

Github also allows different summary views for collaborative issues across multiple repos, which can be helpful for organising larger teams.
