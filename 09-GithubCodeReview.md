title: What Code Review Looks Like in GitHub
---

**Commit changes**: uploading snapshots when the code changes. The history of all changes are therefore saved and can be reverted.

***

**Branching**: keep a version of the code separate while making experimental changes or keeping track of collaborative work. Can try out new functionality or edit in parallel without impacting the code base.

***

**Pull Request**: Bring the changes made on a branch over to the main code base. Can be used to request a code review (see Reviewers on the right panel)
