<hr class="half-width"><p>This chapter gives you an overview of the topics of this course. It
also corresponds to specificity of data science work. They are not
treated in the same order as indicated here.</p>
<p>This program will teach you best practices in data science project
management and how to appyly them to research project. This material
will help you to manage a research project that comprise some <em>online
collaborative working</em>, has a relatively <em>big team, where people
have complementary skills</em>, use <em>coding or programming</em>, as
well as the <em>reuse of code</em>, and last but not least, aim at
producing a <em>reproducible analysis</em>, as is pictured below.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/datasciencespecifics.jpg" alt="Specicity of data science project. Five blocks (working online, large teams whose members have with specialised skills, writing code and re-using code) are placed around a central block where reproducible analysis is written.

this course. Note that the course episode split follows a different
logic, and you will find training linked to each five of these data
science specifics in most episodes.</p>

<p>The principles taught in this course can be applied to any research
project. It will help project manager to work with online tools, with
people with specialised skillsets, and with a project involving some
code writing and code reuse. The goal is to produce a reproducible data
analysis in modern research context.</p>
<p>It requires some specific and some non-specific project management
actions. This course covers a large panel of action to perform before,
during and after the project is conducted.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="online-work">Online work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#online-work"></a></h3>
<p>When part of the work happens online, it becomes very easy to loose
track of what documents are where, what tools were used (by whom), and
who is doing what. Discussions are also more difficult to organise and
meetings are more complex to drive. In this course, we will look at
different elements that make this work easier.</p>
<p>Af first, there should be one entry point for the project, where
every team member can find the main documentation as well as links to
other documents and data. This starts with setting
<code>one main URL</code> when setting up the project, as well as using
good readme files and templates. The information needs to be updated
during the project and shared with the whole team.</p>
<p>The use of online project management tool (like kaban boards for todo
list) can also help members of the team to coordinate their work, and
follow their achievements.</p>

<h3 id="team-science">Team science<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#team-science"></a></h3>
<p>Because teams can be big, and quite heterogeneous in terms of skills
(especially computer and programming skills), it is important to follow
best practice of team building.</p>
<p>In particular, one should set reasonable goals and milestones for the
project, and document them in the main documentation. It is also
important that every team member knows what his part is, and that the
work is well distributed.</p>
<p>One should make sure every team member is able to use the
communication tools set for the team, and take particular care of the
organisation of meetings. Data and code should be documented (and this
documentation work should be fostered), such that every team member can
follow and reuse the work of the other team members.</p>

<h3 id="coding">Coding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#coding"></a></h3>
<p>When data analysis is done via a programming language, things become
mostly easier, but this facility has some drawbacks, as well as some
effects on data management practice.</p>
<p>First, a data analysis workflow will now start with the computer
reading the raw data. This means that the choice of the data format for
the raw data may change, and that manually gathered data should be
(easily) computer readable. This is particularly important for
spreadsheets, as a lot of time can be saved by designing the spreadsheet
in a tidy format.</p>
<p>Second, statistical analysis and data representation in figures will
now be much easier to perform, making p-hacking and harking practices
very easy to do, even involuntarily. Researcher have to actively make
sure their analysis is not flawed.</p>
<p>Third, making errors in the code may have larger effects than making
error in a manual analysis. However, errors are easier to spot (doing
code reviews and tests) and when the code is corrected, the results are
immediately corrected, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="codedata-publication-and-reuse">Code/data publication and reuse<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#codedata-publication-and-reuse"></a></h3>
<p>Very soon in a research project, writing code consist mostly of
taking code written by someone else and applying it (with some tweaks
sometimes) to one own data. We will look at ways to find relevant code,
make sure it can be trusted, make sure you can legally use it, and ways
to cite it (to give recognition the initial software engineer
deserves).</p>
<p>In addition, code written in the project will probably be reused,
too. We will look into best practices to make this reuse easier, both in
how the code is written (modularity, documentation, tests) and in how
the code is shared (license, repository, version control, release, users
instruction, developers instructions).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reproducibility"></a></h3>
<p>At the core of data science, the analysis reproducibiliy is both a
goal and a huge advantage (in terms of research transparency,
trustworthiness and work efficiency). The use of code is not enough to
get a reproducible analysis, one needs to have access to both the code
and the data used to produce the research result, a concept called
provenance. This may not be trivial, especially if several version of
the code and of the data exist.</p>
<p>In this course, we will have a strong emphasis on version control,
while we will introduce the concepts (and some tools) of provenance, as
well as literate programming (reproducible reports and executable
papers), where the code, the figure and explanatory text are bound in
the same file.</p>

manage individuals and teams working on any computational project, which
in the current era is literally all research projects. It is
<em>not</em> about learning how to write code, but building a
foundational understanding for computational methods that could be
applied to your research. Furthermore, this training will provide
guidance for facilitating collaboration and data analysis using tools
like research data management, version control or code review.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the data science knowledge will vary. Nonetheless, we
believe that the data science skills you will learn in this training
will make your research process better. In the following sections, we
will detail what we mean by âbetterâ.</p>

<p>Data science brings some structure in how data is collected,
processed and analysed, making it easier to collaborate on a project, to
publish extra research outputs and leveraging some extra potential your
data may have. In the past, it helped me drive new hypotheses, detect
problems with the research design early, and reduce the sample size
needed to drive a solid conclusion. Eventually, it made my research more
robust and trustworthy. But in the end, my real motivation is
efficiency: very soon, the time I invested in learning and applying data
science in my research was recovered multiple times when a manuscript
had to be written (and re-written).</p>

<p>Once you start using code for analysing your data, it will become
much easier to do complex and informative visualisation. This often
includes way to visualise and label single data points, or use
visualisation on several dimensions (producing moving gifs of a 3D
scatterplot for instance).</p>
<p>One can also automate the figure design choice, so that all figures
look similar. Similarly, the production of several version of the same
figure is very easy. For example, one can use different color pallette,
one using the palette usually used in the field (the one your supervisor
wants to see), and one for color-blind readers.</p>

<p>Good scientific practices are aiming at securing the robustness and

computational reproducibility of your results is a relatively easy step
in making your research more robust.</p>

<p>The reproducibility of an experiment not only requires a detailed
description of the methods and reagents used, but also a detailed
description of the analysis performed. The ultimate description of the
analysis is to provide all elements necessary for reproducing the
analysis (computational reproducibility). This includes the data and the
code used to analyse it (in a form that can be reused in a different
computational environment).</p>

<p>In practice, sometimes one may not be able to provide all elements
openly (for instance, some medical data cannot be shared openly for
privacy reasons) for everyone to be able to reproduce all the results.
But co-workers (and maybe reviewers) should be able to reproduce the
analysis (e.g., on anonymized data).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The emergence of reproducible reports is another aspect of computer
reproducibility. Literate programming using Jupyter notebooks,
Rmarkdown, stencila or quarto (tools that can usually use Python, R, or
Julia) is indeed growing in popularity. These tools allow you to show
data and analysis side by side, with written explanations and
interactive visualisations. These outputs can not only be used as blog
posts, or lab reports, but can also be published as an enhanced
publication, a concept called executable research articles: <a href="https://gmaciocci.medium.com/list/the-evolution-of-executable-research-articles-823e42a9fa60" class="external-link">https://gmaciocci.medium.com/list/the-evolution-of-executable-research-articles-823e42a9fa60</a></p>

authorship in peer reviewed publication, new scientometrics are
developed to recognize publication of other research outputs. In
particular, datasets and software publication are officially reviewed in
the evaluation of certain grant, for example for the Marie-curie
european program. Data science principles will make it easier to publish
datasets, software, reagents or hardware you are anyway producing during

<p>Did you know that manually copy-pasting data is one of the primary
source of data corruption ? Combining datasets or processing data (such
as cleaning or transforming into different formats), can therefore be
best achieved using code. The process is not only safer, but it is often
faster.</p>
<p>Another underevaluated issue is the amount of data you will collect.
The more data you have the more sophisticated tools and workflows you
may need. It is also more likely that your data (or code) gets
corrupted, mixed up, outdated, or lost. In particular, when something
goes wrong during the experiment, code might be used to create warnings,
so that the setup or protocol may be modified on the fly or between
sessions.</p>

<p>While we already mentioned the advantage of reproducibile analysis
for the quality of the research, we did not mention how useful this is
during the research. With reproducible analysis, it is effortless to run
a new dataset in the analysis workflow, it becomes possible to explore
the data at a single experiment level, which may enable new hypotheses,
or spot issues that were not foreseen in the experimental design. It
makes also certain that difference in the figures are due to difference
in the dataset, not any manual processing of the data one may have

<p>Within science teams, group work is critical for experimental design
and implementation. In addition, there are rapid developments in how
scientific results and methods are shared, and collaborations have never
been more global or rapid. This means that several people will likely be
working with the same data files.</p>
<p>Data science allows for the management of how one or multiple people
work on the same project (as well as the same code). It requires
different skillsets than those taught in traditional science courses
<em>or</em> a typical coding class.</p>

<p>At this point, you may be convinced that the extra work of designing
your project using data science principles will be worth it. But here
comes the best argument of all: <strong>in the end you will save
time.</strong> Early time saving comes because your future self and
collaborators will be able to find all your data, reuse and modify your
code, and understand your research faster.</p>
<p>This applies directly to the example of working on article revisions
- will you still remember all the analysis details and data nuances when
your papers comes back with a request for major changes? For instance,
if a colleague cannot find what data goes with which figures, there are
high chances that you will also be unable to find it three years from
now. In addition, itt is not uncommon to modify the design of the
figures multiple times (sometimes back and forth), often modifying all
figures at once.</p>

had all figures 15 minutes later. (Note, after seeing the new figures,
the reviewer agreed that the original version was better).</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
