<hr class="half-width"><p>As a project manager, you do not need to code or know how coding
works. However, it is important to understand the data workflow and
foster documentation, as well as coding best practices, such that you
can understand the analysis.</p>
<p>This chapter gives a small introduction into coding and data analysis
workflow, code modularity, and then how foster good code with tests and
review.</p>
</section><section id="analysis-workflow"><h2 class="section-heading">Analysis workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#analysis-workflow"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>A usual workflow involves some data processing, before the actual
analysis can be done. Statistical analysis and figure production should
be decided before the data is looked at to prevent harking. Explorative
analysis (looking for correlation and interpretation of the results) can
be done anytime, as long as no hypothesis is rejected from that
analysis.</p>

<h3 id="data-pre-processing">Data (pre-)processing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-pre-processing"></a></h3>
<p>Code that cleans and processes data (<strong>processing
code</strong>) provides the very beginning of the data analysis
pipeline: starting with raw data and resulting in processed data. When
the data was not collected in a computer readable format, or when
metadata is missing, this step can be the most time consuming of
all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data wrangling involves cleaning data so it can be easily read and
analysed by machines. It can also involve integration, extraction,
removing missing points, and anything that makes data useable and
functional. Regardless of the methods, the code involved with data
cleaning steps should be carefully documented so that the steps involved
can be repeated from raw data to cleaned data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Data wrangling can be a manual or automated process. In scenarios
where datasets are exceptionally large, automated data cleaning becomes
a necessity.</p>
<p>Cleaning data means it can be easily read and analysed by machines
and used in analysis pipelines. It can involve changing labels,
subsetting, integration, extraction, removing missing points, and
anything that makes data usable and functional.</p>
<p>Regardless of the methods, the code involved in data cleaning steps
should be carefully documented so that the steps involved can be
repeated from raw data to clean data. When reviewing this type of code,
consider whether the steps involved are readable and in the correct
order. Especially, when filtering data out, this should be consistent
and indicated in the main method description.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><div class="warnings">
<p>Visualising data before designing the data analysis is a form of
harking, as you will cherry pick your data (filtering some data out) or
cherry pick an analysis (what looks promising). You should always design
your analysis before visualising the data, or use visualised data as
training data, not included in the final analysis.</p>
</div>
<p>With readable, clean, processed data, the next stage of the data
pipeline is analysis.</p>
<p>Depending on your computational project, this may involve elaborate
and complex analyses, modelling, simulation, and even machine learning.
However, even if this step is just running a single statistics test,
keeping the code documented and modular in clearly defined steps is
key.</p>
<p>Here is an example of applying a Butterworth filter to some data in
Python. The specifics donât matter, you can consider this code
pseudocode for any kind of analysis step.</p>
<pre><code>genomeProject/analysis/01_butterworth_filter.py

#### 01_butterworth_filter, v1.0
##this code read processed data and apply a low pass filter,
## the output variable is called  filtered_data

#  Import dependencies
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import butter,filtfilt

# (A) Read processed data from file
df = pd.read_csv('genomeProject/data/220103_GenomicData_processed.csv')

# (B) Defining filter parameters
T = 5.0         # Sample Period
fs = 30.0       # sample rate, Hz
cutoff = 2      # desired cutoff frequency of the filter, Hz
nyq = 0.5 * fs  # Nyquist Frequency
order = 2       # quadratic
n = int(T * fs) # total number of samples

# (C) Define the Butterworth Filter Function
def butter_lowpass_filter(data, cutoff, fs, order):
    normal_cutoff = cutoff / nyq

    # Get the filter coefficients 
    b, a = butter(order, normal_cutoff, btype='low', analog=False)
    filtered_data = filtfilt(b, a, data)

    return filtered_data

# (D) Apply Butterworth Filter Function to the data
filtered_data = butter_lowpass_filter(df, cutoff, fs, order)

<h3 id="figures-for-communicating-results">Figures for Communicating Results<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#figures-for-communicating-results"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When working with data sets, <code>ggplot</code> (in R) or
<code>matplotlib</code>/<code>seaborn</code> (in Python) libraries
provide attractive figures that can be produced very quickly.
Visualising data should not not wait for the point of publication, and
can be used to explore data from the start, and also illustrate
methodology. This is particularly valuable in Jupyter Notebooks. Code to
produce figures should be literate, functional, reuseable in the same
way as data cleaning and analysis code. That way future visualisations
can be easily updated or reused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the analysis complete, data visualisation is usually used to
communicate results. The code used to produce figures is often the next
step in the data pipeline.</p>
<p>For publications or posters, well-constructed figures improve science
communication and help improve the impact of your research. Being able
to produce multipanel figures with annotations and different colour
schemes is complex but one of the advantages of learning a data science
language.</p>
<p>It is therefore worth taking the time for researchers to learn the
technical skills in R, Python, or another language to produce
visualisations. Producing figures in Excel is limiting and often
frustrating, particularly as there are only limited options in layout
and type of figure.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>Selection of appropriate statistical method is very important step in
analysis of data. A wrong selection of the statistical method not only
creates some serious problem during the interpretation of the findings
but also affects the conclusion of the study. In statistics, for each
specific situation, statistical methods are available to analysis and
interpretation of the data. To select the appropriate statistical
method, one need to know the assumption and conditions of the
statistical methods, so that proper statistical method can be selected
for data analysis. Other than knowledge of the statistical methods,
another very important aspect is nature and type of the data collected
and objective of the study because as per objective, corresponding
statistical methods are selected which are suitable on given data.
Incorrect statistical methods can be seen in many conditions like use of
unpaired t-test on paired data or use of parametric test for the data
which does not follow the normal distribution, etc., Two main
statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics,
which summarizes data using indexes such as mean, median, standard
deviation and another is inferential statistics, which draws conclusions
from data using statistical tests such as studentâs t-test, ANOVA test,
and many others</p>

<li>importing all dependencies</li>
<li>reading inputs, naming outputs</li>

</ul><p>The latter element is particularly important. Variables are often a
decision taken (for instance it could be some threshold value used for
filtering data out, a type of low-pass filter used, or a time window
that sub-set the data). Defining them at the start of the code makes it
easier to change and spot.</p>
<p>In practice, your figure and analysis may well depend on the version
of the data, code and these variables, so it is often interesting to
include this information into the output of the code. This may take the

options:</p>

documentation and the code are integrated in one file, which produce one
output (html of pdf most of the time).</p>

<p>Applying methods from one personâs work and applying it to another
problem can take weeks, if not months, of work. Applying methods from
publications is even harder: static PDF files canât describe the lines
of code and data that lead to those discoveries. This is an increasingly
important problem in the face of growing mistrust in science, and a
reproducibility crisis plaguing the sciences.</p>
<p>Instead, functional programming is about writing code that works as
modular steps. Each step is clearly commented on and carefully produced
so that it can be reused in different contexts. Often when you are
analysing data, you need to repeat the same task many times. For
example, you might have several files that all need loading and clean in
the same way, or you might need to perform the same analysis for
multiple species or parameters. Rather than copying and pasting, writing
a function and calling that function leads to fewer errors and confusion
overall.</p>
<p>We can think of this on a broad scale, say one studentâs
computational work has the following steps, where blue shows data
cleaning, and yellow the analysis and statistics.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/IMP-pipeline1.png" alt="drawing" width="600" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Another student can take reuse the data cleaning and initial
visualisation steps because her data was from the same source and is in
the same format. She can later add her own model:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/IMP-pipeline2.png" alt="drawing" width="600" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>On the micro-scale, functional programming ensures that each code
file itself is comprised of modular blocks, whether for data processing,
analysis pipeline, simulation and so on. Depending on your programming
language, these may be used as a package or a library or saved in files
that are available for installation. Just the same as the diagram above,
making sure functions are robust and reuseable means they can be shared
throughout different workflows and for different projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Training in functional programming is usually an excellent
pre-requisite for members of your lab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A first step can be to <strong>draw out</strong> and create diagrams
to plan code before starting and identifying the modular steps involved.
This does not require technical knowledge of a language and is,
therefore, a great exercise for direct supervision. You can find
practical details on reproducible code in the <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/guides-to" class="external-link">Guides

<p>It is very, very easy to make mistakes when coding. A single wrong
use of a character can cause a programâs output to be entirely wrong.
Missing one data point, writing plus instead of minus symbol or using
feet instead of meters might be a genuine human mistake, but in
research, the results can be catastrophic. Careers can be damaged/ended,
vast sums of research funds can be wasted, and valuable time may be lost
exploring incorrect avenues. This is why code testing is vital.</p>
<p>Testing is a learned skill that needs to become a part of working
on/improving a project. After changing their code, researchers should
always check that their changes or fixes have not broken anything. It
also helps deciding when dependencies can be updated. There are several
different kinds of testing and each has best practices specific to
them.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of writing code is always to make it
understandable to other people, including yourself a few months down the
track. Thereâs certainly no shame in finding out that your code wasnât

<p>A simple objective of the review process is to catch bugs and
elementary errors that might have been missed during the development
phase. Code review can also help improve the overall quality while
ensuring that code is readable and easy to understand. As a group
leader, you can also make sure code is functional and literate as early
as possible, and encourage your students to avoid messy âgood enoughâ
code that causes chaos later.</p>
<p>Code review is often done in pairs, with each reviewer also having
some of their code reviewed by their partner. Doing this can help
programmers to see and discuss issues and alternative approaches to
tasks, and to learn new tips and tricks.</p>

<p>Making sure everyone is free at the same time for a lab meeting can
be challenging. Hence, asynchronous code review practices are more
suitable for busy supervisors or collaborators in different time
zones.</p>
<p>The asynchronous review process allows others to run the code
themselves using a reproducible environment, or simply reads through the
scripts and share their feedback asynchronously.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A postdoc has created a model in Python and creates a Binder with all
the dependencies necessary. She sends the file to her supervisor who can
run the code within her browser, no installation is required. The
supervisor can then run the code herself to review it and check the
individual parts over the next week. The supervisor adds a commented
version of the script to the postdocâs repo with a merge request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reviewing code in small chunks incrementally as the project is
developing can help make the code review process a lot more efficient.
Asynchronous feedback removes the time pressure but can be easily
forgotten!</p>

Way: Recommendations for Code Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Unlike traditional, âacademic-styleâ peer review, most code review
systems have several advantages: theyâre rarely anonymous, theyâre
public-facing, and without the broker of an editor, contact between
reviewer and reviewee can be direct and rapid. This means code review is
typically a fast, flexible, and interactive process.</p>

<p>In a group of 11 programs developed by the same group of people, the
first 5 were developed without reviews. The remaining 6 were developed
with reviews. After all the programs were released to production, the
first 5 had an average of 4.5 errors per 100 lines of code. The 6 that
had been inspected had an average of only 0.82 errors per 100. Reviews
cut the errors by over 80 percent.</p>

bug once all the figures have been produced and conclusions drawn, or,

<p><strong>Important things to bear in mind:</strong></p>
<p>Code reviews should not be used to evaluate individuals and their
skill levels. An open and safe environment where revealing mistakes and
errors should not come with penalties or shame. Code reviews should also
be done early and often, to normalise this practice in the research
team.</p>
<p>In their book <strong>Peer Reviews in Software: A Practical
Guide</strong>, Karl E. Wiegers says:</p>
<p><em>The temptation to perfect the product before you allow another
pair of eyes to see it. This is an ego-protecting strategy: you wonât
feel embarrassed about your mistakes if no one else sees them. â¦review
[is not] a seal of approval but rather in-process quality-improvement
activity. Such reluctance has several unfortunate consequences. If your
work isnât reviewed until you think itâs complete, you are
psychologically resistant to suggestions for changes.</em></p>
<p>If the program runs, how bad can it be? You are likely to rationalise
away possible bugs because you believe youâve finished and youâre eager
to move on to the next task. Relying on your own desk checking and unit
testing ignores the greater efficiency of a peer review for finding many
defects*</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>As well as reviewing specific scripts and analyses written by a
single individual, can be very beneficial to solving programming
problems as a team. Setting aside an afternoon to work as a group will
help teach less experienced members of the group and more efficiently
solve very difficult problems.</p>
<p>Groups of people working on a specific problem are often known as
âHackathonsâ in programming. These can last multiple days (hopefully
with downtime!). With very large groups, people can work in pairs or
small groups with delegated parts of the problem to solve and regularly
meet back together to discuss and evaluate. If there is a complex
solution in computational methods that most people in the group need, it
makes sense to find it together.</p>
<p>Similarly, documentation sprints are useful to dedicate time to
regularly bring a codebase to a good minimum standard. Splitting the
task across the team as an event, creating documentation and working
examples for code repos and releasing it can help others use your
computational methods and tools to increase the impact of your work.
Having regularly updated documentation also reduces onboarding time for
new members picking up the shared methods in the lab.</p>
<p>Group work shares the burden and allows knowledge exchange and
support within the team.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous integration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#continuous-integration"></a></h3>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of integrating changes to
a project made by individuals into a main, shared version frequently
(usually multiple times per day). CI is also typically used to identify
any conflicts and bugs that are introduced by changes, so they are found
and fixed early, minimising the effort required to do so. Running tests
regularly also saves humans from needing to do it manually. By making
users aware of bugs as early as possible researchers (if the project is
a research project) do not waste a lot of time doing work that may need
to be thrown away, which may be the case if tests are run infrequently
and results are produced using faulty code. There are many CI service
providers, such as GitHub Actions that come with their own advantages
and disadvantages.</p>
