### Provide a Process for Documentation

Most researchers find documentation daunting, as they think that research-related responsibilities are already overwhelming for them.
It's obvious that they see documentation as an  'added labour' and not important enough for carrying out a research design, implementation, analysis or publication work.

The reality is that documentation is an integral part of all research processes, from start to finish.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  checklist

## A systematic process for documentation is more than a formal book-keeping practice because it:

- allows everyone in your research to understand the research direction and track progress;
- adds validity to your research work when systematically built on published peer-reviewed work;
- communicates different ways to contribute, enabling diverse participation in the co-development;
- upholds practices to ensure equity, diversity and inclusion;
- recognises contributions fairly;
- gives and shares credits for all work;
- tracks the history of what worked or what did not work;
- creates transparency about early and intermediate research outcomes;
- makes auditing easy for funders, advisors or data managers;
- helps reframe research narratives by connecting different work;
- explains all decisions and stakeholders impacted by that;
- gives the starting point for writing manuscript and publication; and more!

### Facilitating Documentation in your Team

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## NOTE

Whatever your approach is, be firm about making documentation a shared responsibility so that this job does not solely fall on the shoulders of early career researchers, members from traditionally marginalised groups or support staff.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The biggest question here is probably not 'why' but 'how' to facilitate documentation so that it is not challenging or burdensome for the team members.
Here are a few recommendations to make documentation easier:

- Allocate some time at the beginning of the project to discuss with the main leaders and researchers of the project about what should be documented.
- Keep the tasks simple by establishing a shared repository for documentation with standard templates to guide how one should go about documenting their work (*It is always easier to start with a template than an empty sheet!*).
- Add documentation sprint to your project timelines and milestones to make sure that everyone is aware of their importance in the project.
- Create visible ways to recognise and incentivise the process of documenting.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Version controlled repository help record different contributions and contributor information openly.
- Open Science is an umbrella term that involve different practices for research in the context of different research objects.
- Online Persistent Identifiers or Digital Object Identifiers are useful for releasing and citing different versions of research objects.
