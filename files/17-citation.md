## Citing others

You should cite research objects directly in the paper in places where it is relevant.
This is a commonly practiced way of citing publications and is valid for citing other research components like data, hardware and software.

A citation includes the following information:
- Author
- Title
- Year of publication
- Publisher (for data, this is often the data repository where it is housed)
- Version (if indicated)
- Access information (a URL or DOI)

You should use a citation manager to collect and use this information, [zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is the free and open source software option.

If the author of the  research object did not provide a easy way to collect the information, try to contact them. You can refer them to the [turing way chapter] (https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable.html) , which is also a source for this course.

## Citing yourself

Make your research objects are citable, as described later. Then do not forget to insert citation of these research objects in your own papers. Provide data, software and hardware availability statement, for example:

The data/software/harware that support the findings will be available in [repository name] at [URL / DOI] following a [6 month] embargo from the date of publication, to allow for the commercialization of research findings.‚Äù

Note that you can often reserve a DOI without publishing your data and code, if you want for the paper to come out first.
